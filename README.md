## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

The current issue with food wastage in handling stages of a Restaurant Supply Chain.

### How our technology solution can help

Ou technology can be used by a variety of stakeholders not limited to Restaurant Sales Owners, Inventory Managers, and Individual Suppliers to effectively manage raw materials.

### Our idea

In today's fast-paced world, where convenience often trumps sustainability, we've identified a pressing issue in the restaurant industry â€“ the sustainability of supply chains. As we transition from fast food to sustainable food, we're proud to present our innovative solution. This is not just a product; it's a commitment to creating a better world.

Restaurant Supply Chains Issues

Before we delve into our solution, let's understand the real-world problems we've uncovered. Traditional restaurant supply chains are plagued by several issues:

1. Ground Level Wastage Due to Uncertain Demand Trends

Restaurants often overstock or understock raw materials, resulting in wastage or shortages due to unpredictable customer demands.
2. Issues with Ground Level Suppliers

Communication gaps and inefficiencies between restaurants and their suppliers lead to inefficiencies, delays, and occasional quality issues.
3. Less Community Engagement

Many unused or near shelf-life items go to waste, with little effort to engage with the local community or reduce this waste.
4. Lack of Communication Among Sectors of the Supply Chain

The different components of the supply chain often work in isolation, leading to mismanagement, inefficiency, and excess wastage.
So, What Is Our Solution?

Our solution is a technological leap forward, merging the power of AI and community engagement to address these pressing issues.

1. Effective Forecast on Raw Materials Usage Based on Sales Data Using AI

We employ cutting-edge artificial intelligence to forecast raw material requirements based on real-time sales data. Our system continuously analyzes past trends and current sales to project raw material needs for the next 10 days, ensuring that restaurants maintain optimal inventory levels.

This data is accessible to Inventory Owners and Managers, who can compare it with their current stocks, giving them a comprehensive view of their inventory health.

2. Alert System on Forecasted Data to Individual Suppliers

To bridge the communication gap with suppliers, we have created an alert system that automatically notifies individual suppliers about their specific inventory requirements. This means that suppliers can plan production and deliveries with precision, reducing wastage and ensuring a steady supply to restaurants.

This seamless communication streamlines the supply chain, making it more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable.

3. Community Items

As part of our commitment to sustainable practices, we've integrated a feature that allows restaurants to identify unrequired or near shelf-life items. These items can then be broadcasted as community items, creating an opportunity for social impact.

Registered NGOs and shelters can view the available community items and book them based on their specific needs. This reduces food waste and strengthens the bond between restaurants and the local community.

Why It's an Improvement Over Existing Solutions

Our solution represents a holistic approach to the sustainability problem in restaurant supply chains. By leveraging AI to optimize inventory management and fostering community engagement, we tackle multiple issues at once:

1. Reduced Wastage

Our AI-driven forecasts help restaurants reduce wastage by ensuring they maintain just the right amount of inventory, minimizing overstocking and understocking.
2. Efficient Supply Chain Management

The alert system bridges the gap between restaurants and suppliers, fostering better communication and more efficient supply chain management.
3. Social Impact

Our community items feature not only prevents food waste but also creates opportunities for local NGOs and shelters to access essential resources.
In summary, our solution isn't just about technology; it's about transforming the restaurant industry into a more sustainable and socially responsible one. We believe that this journey from fast food to sustainable food is a collective effort, and we invite you to join us in making a better world one meal at a time.

## Presentation materials

_INSTRUCTIONS: The following deliverables should be officially posted to your My Team > Submissions section of the [Call for Code Global Challenge resources site](https://cfc-prod.skillsnetwork.site/), but you can also include them here for completeness. Replace the examples seen here with your own deliverable links._


In the future, we plan to...

Implement generative AI to alert end users of better food sustainability standards.
Create a chatbot to alert the inventory manager for the best course of action for an item that is going to expire.
